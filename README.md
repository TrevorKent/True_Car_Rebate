# True_Car_Rebate
Rebate and incentive data for North American light vehcle car market.

# Project Goal:
Demonstrate the two ways Python's Matplotlib library can be used to generate graphs. The simplest method is to use the plt function that is part of the Pandas library. However, that does limit your ability create certian types of charts, such as double y-axis and bubble charts. The better approach is to use sub-plots that allow for greater customization as well as displaying multi-plots on a single page.

# About The Data:
